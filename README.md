# Tactical RPG Prototype  

A **tactical RPG prototype** built in **Unreal Engine (C++)**, featuring **grid-based movement**, **A\* pathfinding**, and a custom **hatching post-process shader** that creates a hand-drawn, pencil-style look.  

This project explores **gameplay systems** for tactical movement, **AI navigation**, and **stylized rendering** through shaders.

## 🛠️ Features  

- **Grid-Based Movement** – Units move across a defined grid, enabling turn-based tactical gameplay.  
- **A\* Pathfinding** – Implements A-star pathfinding for efficient, intelligent navigation.  
- **Hatching Shader** – A stylized post-process shader mimicking pencil sketch aesthetics to enhance the visual mood that inverse when switching player.

## 📌 Status  

This project is a **prototype and technical exploration** into core systems of tactical RPGs and stylized rendering in Unreal Engine.  
Created to familiarize myself with C++ and have fun with shaders.
